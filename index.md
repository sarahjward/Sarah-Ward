## About

I am a M.S. student at Southeastern Louisiana University studying in Dr. Kyle Piller's Lab (kylepiller.com/people/). My master's research is assessing molecular and morphological variation within the _Italic_Poeciliopsis gracilis_Italic_ complex (Cyprinodontiformes: Poeciliidae) in a phylogeographic context. 

I am using a variety of molecular (CytB and ddRADseq) and morphological (pigmentation and morphometrics) approaches to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of _Italic_Poecilopsis_Italic_ in a phylogenetic framework across their range in Mexico and Central America.
